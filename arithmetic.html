                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Arithmetic coding is a lossless data compression technique
                    that maps a sequence of symbols to a single fractional
                    number in the interval [0,1], which can then be represented
                    using fewer bits than the original symbols, thus reducing the
                    overall file size.<br>
                    <br>
                    A fundamental concept in arithmetic coding, probability
                    distributions determine the likelihood of a symbol appearing
                    in the data stream and are used to calculate cumulative
                    probabilities for encoding.

                            The frequency of occurrence for each symbol in the
                            input message is calculated and their corresponding
                            probabilities are determined.

                            The cumulative probability distribution is calculated for
                            each symbol based on the symbol probabilities.</li>

                                The input message is mapped to a single interval based on the cumulative probability distribution of the
                                symbols</li>

                                    The interval is re-normalized after each symbol is
                                    encoded or decoded to maintain the accuracy of the
                                    probability distribution.</li>

                    <p>Let us consider a three letter alphabet A = a1, a2, a3 probabilities P(a1) = 0.4, P (a2) = 0.3. P (a3) = 0.3 The initial
                        sub-intervals are [0.0, 0.4), [0.4, 0.7),[0.7, 1.0). If the first
                        symbol encountered is, a2 then the sub-interval [0.4, 0.7) is
                        considered. If the next two symbols are a3 and, a1 then the
                        intervals get narrowed. This process is illustrated in Fig 9.
                        Any number within the final range[0.4, 0.448) can be used
                        to represent the sequence.
