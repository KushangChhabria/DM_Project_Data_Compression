                <h2>Huffman Coding</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Huffman coding is an algorithm utilized for data compression
                    and serves as the fundamental principle behind file compression. we then shall discuss the generalities of fixed- length
                    and variable-length encoding, uniquely decodable codes,
                    prefix rules, and the structure of a Huffman Tree</p>
                <br>
                <h2>History</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>In 1952, MIT graduate David Albert Huffman and his
                    classmates in the information theory course were faced with a
                    decision between writing a term paper or taking a final exam.
                    Their professor, Robert M. Fano, assigned them a term paper
                    focused on the problem of discovering the most effective
                    binary code. Initially, Huffman struggled to demonstrate
                    the efficiency of any codes and contemplated giving up to
                    concentrate on studying for the final exam. However, hehad a breakthrough idea: utilizing a frequency-sorted binary
                    tree. Through quick experimentation, Huffman successfully
                    proved that this method was the most efficient approach.
                    Huffman’s achievement surpassed that of Fano, who had
                    collaborated with Claude Shannon to develop a similar
                    coding technique. Huffman made sure the tree was optimal
                    by building it from the ground up, which stands out in
                    contrast to Shannon-Fano Coding’s top-down method.
                    Introduction Traditionally, characters are represented as sequences of 0s and 1s and stored using 8 bits, which is referred
                    to as ”fixed-length encoding.” Each character occupies the
                    same number of fixed bits, resulting in a consistent storage
                    size.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <p>Reducing Storage Space To minimize the space required
                        for character storage, we can employ ”variable-length encoding.” This technique leverages the varying frequencies
                        of characters within a given text to design an algorithm
                        that represents the text using fewer bits. In variable-length
                        encoding, characters are assigned a variable number of
                        bits based on their frequency in the text. Consequently,
                        some characters may be encoded with a single bit, while
                        others might require two, three, or more bits. However, the
                        challenge with variable-length encoding lies in decoding the
                        encoded data.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>The Decoding Dilemma</h2>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>Ensuring Uniqueness:
                            : Consider the string ”aabacdab” comprising eight
                            characters and utilizing 64 bits of storage using fixed-length
                            encoding. If we examine the frequency of characters in this
                            string (a: 4, b: 2, c: 1, d: 1), we can attempt to represent it
                            using fewer bits by capitalizing on the fact that the character
                            ’a’ occurs more frequently than ’b,’ and ’b’ occurs more
                            frequently than ’c’ and ’d’.
                            Let’s arbitrarily assign the following codes:
                            a: 0 b: 11 c: 100 d: 011
                            Therefore, using the previously stated codes, the
                            string ”aabacdab” will be encoded as 00110100011011
                            (0—0—11—0—100—011—0—11).
                            However, the real challenge lies in decoding this
                            encoded string. Decoding ”00110100011011” can
                            lead to ambiguity, resulting in multiple possible
                            interpretations: 0—011—0—100—011—0—11 =¿
                            adacdab 0—0—11—0—100—0—11—011 =¿ aabacabd
                            0—011—0—100—0—11—0—11 =¿ adacabab ...
                            To prevent decoding ambiguities, we need to ensure that
                            our encoding adheres to the ”prefix rule,” thereby creating
                            ”uniquely decodable codes.” The prefix rule stipulates that
                            no code should be a prefix of another code. In the previous
                            example, the code 0 is a prefix of 011, violating the prefix
                            rule. If we satisfy the prefix rule, decoding will be distinct.
                            Let’s reconsider the previous example. This time, we will
                            assign codes that comply with the prefix rule for characters
                            ’a,’ ’b,’ ’c,’ and ’d’:
                            a =¿ 0 b =¿10 c =¿110 d =¿111 Using these updated codes,the string ”aabacdab” can be encoded as 00100110111010
                            (0—0—10—0—110—111—0—10). we can then uniquely
                            encode 00100110111010 back to the original string,
                            ”aabacdab.”
                            Now that we have comprehended variable-length encoding
                            and the prefix rule, let’s delve into Huffman coding.
                            Huffman Coding the technique involves constructing a
                            binary tree composed of nodes, which can either be leaf
                            nodes or internal nodes. At first, all nodes are leaf nodes that
                            store the character and its weight (frequency of appearance).</p>
                            <p>Huffman coding can be done with the following steps:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>1. Calculating the frequency of every character in the

                            value of z should be set as the sum of two minimum
                            frequencies. Getting the sum of the least numbers
